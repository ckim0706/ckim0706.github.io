        <h3>Test-Driven Development</h3>
        <h4>November 8, 2014</h4>
        <p>
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a coding methodology that encourages simple designs and inspires confidence. TDD is rediscovered by Kent Beck that relies on short development cycles. 

The steps for TDD are :
1. Add a test
2. Run all tests and if the new ones fails
3. Write some code
4. Run tests
5. Refactor code
6. Repeat

The benefits of TDD are that programmers who wrote tests were more productive. Writing tests allow programmers to focus on the end-user requirements and derive the best solutions in their coding design. TDD can lead to more modularized, flexible, and extensible code.

However, as with every subject, there are shortcomings. TDD cannot operate efficiently without the management support since writing tests = time to write/maintain and money. TDD is a programming methodology, which means that it is systematic, but working alone might defer this process. Pair-programming is a solution, since the roles of driver/navigator ensures that each of the steps are implemented and discussed for better designs.

There are numerous programming methodologies such as SCRUM, AGILE, and etc. One cannot say that one method is better than the other due to the context of the programmer and the environment. However, from many blogs and related searches, TDD is definitely catching attention from well-known programmers. 

Finally, whether we use TDD or other methods, we must always remember to keep our code efficient and DRY so that our work can be reused by ourselves and our peers.
